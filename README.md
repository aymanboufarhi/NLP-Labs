# NLP-Labs

This repository presents the four labs I completed during my first year in the Master's program, specifically in the subject of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Each lab focuses on different aspects and techniques in NLP, including but not limited to:

- Text Preprocessing : Techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- Text Classification : Implementation of various classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
- Sentiment Analysis : Analyzing sentiments in text data using different models and libraries.
- Language Modeling : Building and training language models using techniques such as N-grams and neural networks.

These labs showcase practical applications and understanding of NLP concepts and techniques.
